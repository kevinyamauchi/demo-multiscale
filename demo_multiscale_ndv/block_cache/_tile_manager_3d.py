"""Tile manager with LRU eviction and late tilemap insertion.

Key design principle: ``tilemap`` is a *committed* state only.
``stage()`` allocates slots but does **not** insert them into ``tilemap``
— it puts them in ``_in_flight`` instead.  Only ``commit()`` moves a
brick from ``_in_flight`` into ``tilemap``, and only after the data has
been written to the GPU cache.  This means:

* ``rebuild_lut()`` only ever sees bricks with valid data.
* Cancelling an async load is clean: call ``release_all_in_flight()``
  and the reserved-but-never-written slots are returned to the free list
  without touching ``tilemap``.

LRU eviction with a min-heap
-----------------------------
A min-heap keeps the entry with the smallest timestamp at index 0, so
finding the LRU victim is O(1) and removing it is O(log N).  This reduces
``stage()`` from O(misses x N) to O(misses x log N).

Lazy deletion
-------------
Cache hits update a slot's timestamp in ``tilemap`` but do not update the
heap, because finding and fixing the heap entry would itself be O(N).
Instead the heap holds **stale entries** whose recorded timestamp no
longer matches the slot's current timestamp.  ``_evict_lru`` discards
stale entries lazily when it pops them.  Each entry is pushed once and
popped once, so all operations are O(log N) amortised.
